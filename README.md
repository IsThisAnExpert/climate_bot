# :seedling: @IsThisAnExpert: The ClimateChange Hackathon bot!

It can be difficult for the average user of a social media platform to identify if a post on the climate crisis is based on a reliable source or misinformation. As a consequence, erroneous ‘news’ are reproduced or go viral. Some users even intentionally mislead the internet community. This behaviour can cause confusion in raising awareness and taking action on the climate crisis.
`@IsThisAnExpert` is a Twitter bot that helps users see the credibility of another user on the climate crisis. Reply to a post on climate change to `@IsThisAnExpert` and it will run an assessment on the credibility of the user and their expertise on climate change. Created for the [ClimateChange Hackaton](https://www.goethe.de/prj/one/en/gea/for/clc.html) in frame of the [GENERATION A ](https://www.goethe.de/prj/one/en/gea.html) — project.

## What it does

1. Parses a manually curated list of experts and assigns a credibility score following a *credibility score* equation(see below).
2. Populates a MariaDB database with relevant user information.
3. Opens a stream on Twitter to hear any post with an `@IsThisAnExpert` mention.
4. Calculates the credibility score for the user posting the message where the bot is called.*
5. Replies to the mention with a message with the credibility score of the person.

## Credibility score

A user’s credibility score is calculated by tweets and retweets of credible sources. A scientist affiliated with the IPCC, a reputable institution, many publications and citations (therefore a high h-index) will have a high credibility score. A random user that has frequently retweeted the IPCC report will be assigned with a higher credibility score than Donald Trump who does not make references to credible sources.


###### \*future feature, currently calculates the *cred_score* for the users on the curated list
